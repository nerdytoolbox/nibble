				{`We all know the feeling—reaching for a snack not because we’re hungry, but because we’re bored. Nibble is here to help you break that cycle. Instead of mindlessly eating, Nibble gives you a quick and fun alternative: a random task designed to keep your hands and mind busy.

				With just one tap, you’ll get a simple suggestion—something small you can do right away instead of snacking out of boredom. You can also add your own personalized Nibbles to the list, making the app uniquely yours and filled with tasks that actually inspire you.

				Nibble isn’t about strict dieting or restriction. It’s about awareness, choice, and giving yourself better options in the moments when you need them most.

				Whether you’re looking to cut back on boredom snacking, build healthier habits, or simply bring more mindfulness into your day, Nibble is your little companion to keep you on track—one small task at a time.`}
